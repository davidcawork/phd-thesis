One of the most widely accepted standards for power system communication is IEC 61850, which defines services and protocols with different requirements that need to be fulfilled with traffic engineering techniques. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of a novel management framework to meet these requirements through control and monitoring tools that provide a global view of the network. With this purpose, we provide an overview of relevant Software Defined Networking (SDN) related approaches, and we describe an architecture based on OpenFlow that establishes different types of flows according to their needs and the network status. We present the implementation of the architecture and evaluate its capabilities using the Mininet network emulator.}

However, embracing a new and futuristic paradigm as an alternative to well-established and mature legacy networking paradigm requires a lot of time along with considerable financial resources and technical expertise. Consequently, many enterprises cannot afford it. A compromise solution then is a hybrid networking environment (a.k.a. Hybrid SDN (hSDN)) in which SDN functionalities are leveraged while existing traditional network infrastructures are acknowledged. Recently, hSDN has been seen as a viable networking solution for a diverse range of businesses and organizations. Accordingly, the body of literature on hSDN research has improved remarkably. On this account, we present this paper as a comprehensive state-of-the-art survey which expands upon hSDN from many different perspectives.}

abstract="Software Defined Networking (SDN) enables flexible and dynamic control of packet forwarding and processing by decoupling the control plane and the data plane. However, to implement an efficient and reliable in-band SDN control channel to connect controller(s) and switch/router(s), conventional static schemes such as VLAN are insufficient especially in highly utilized and/or network-topology variable wireless networks. Therefore, a dynamic in-band control channel is considered which can piggyback (embed) control messages onto data packets flowing on the network. In this paper, we report a feasibility study on the dynamic in-band control channel implemented on the BMv2 router in Programming Protocol Independent Packet Processors (P4) framework. The adverse impact on the data plane performance is experimentally investigated. It is found that the TCP goodput and packet loss characteristics are degraded as the amount of embedded information increases but the significant impact comes from not embedding/extracting the control information on data packets but sending the extracted information to a controller; which give us hints to applicable conditions and possible improvements on the dynamic in-band control channel implementation.",

abstract = {A distinguishing characteristic of a software-defined network is separation of the network's control plane from its data plane. Especially when the granularity of control is an individual network flow, such separation entails frequent communications between these two planes. This communication pattern demands the same level of resilience from the control plane as that from the data plane, and thus calls into question the conventional out-of-band control network design as used in many existing SDN systems. Peregrine is an Ethernet-based software-defined network that was originally designed as the internal network of a container computer, and unifies storage access, inter-server communication, and network control into a single network comprising only commodity off-the-shelf Ethernet switches. To fully utilize all available physical network links, Peregrine treats the physical network as an explicitly routed mesh and equalizes the loads of its links using a global load-balancing routing algorithm running on a centralized controller. The in-band control architecture of Peregrine leads to two issues: (1) how to evolve a Peregrine network from its initial bootstrapping mode to the explicit routing mode at run time, and (2) how to support fast fail-over for physical failures that break both the control and data plane. This paper describes how Peregrine addresses these two issues, and shows its effectiveness with performance measurements collected from a fully operational test-bed.},

planes should be distributed. However, distributed control
planes are challenging to design and bootstrap, especially if
this is done in-band, without a dedicated control network,
and without relying on legacy protocols. We present Medieval,
a plug \& play, distributed control plane that supports
automatic topology discovery and management, as well as
flexible control plane membership: controllers can be added
and removed dynamically. Medieval comes with interesting
robustness guarantees and is provably self-stabilizing: from
any initial topology, the controllers quickly self-organize
and establish a communication channel among themselves.
Given the resulting managed control plane, arbitrary network
control services can be implemented on top. Interestingly,
Medieval is also self-reliant, in the sense that it is
based on OpenFlow only, and does not require any legacy
protocol to bootstrap.},

abstract = {By introducing programmability, automated verification, and innovative debugging tools, Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) are poised to meet the increasingly stringent dependability requirements of today's communication networks. However, the design of fault-tolerant SDNs remains an open challenge. This paper considers the design of dependable SDNs through the lenses of self-stabilization—a very strong notion of fault-tolerance. In particular, we develop algorithms for an in-band and distributed control plane for SDNs, called Renaissance, which tolerate a wide range of failures. Our self-stabilizing algorithms ensure that after the occurrence of arbitrary failures, (i) every non-faulty SDN controller can reach any switch (or another controller) within a bounded communication delay (in the presence of a bounded number of failures) and (ii) every switch is managed by a controller. We evaluate Renaissance through a rigorous worst-case analysis as well as a prototype implementation (based on OVS and Floodlight, and Mininet).}

abstract = {Fog computing is a paradigm that allows the provisioning of computational resources and services at the edge of the network, closer to the end devices and users, complementing cloud computing. The heterogeneity and large number of devices are challenges to obtaining optimized resource allocation in this environment. Over time, some surveys have been presented on resource management in fog computing. However, they now lack a broader and deeper view about this subject, considering the recent publications. This article presents a systematic literature review with a focus on resource allocation for fog computing, and in a more comprehensive way than the existing works. The survey is based on 108 selected publications from 2012 to 2022. The analysis have exposed their main techniques, metrics used, evaluation tools, virtualization methods, architecture, and domains where the proposed solutions were applied. The results show an updated and comprehensive view about resource allocation in fog computing. The main challenges and open research questions are discussed, and a new fog computing resource management cycle is proposed.},

abstract = {Limited battery and computing resources of mobile devices (MDs) induce performance limitations in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. Computational offloading has the capability to provide computing and storage resources to MDs for resource-intensive tasks execution. Therefore, to minimize energy consumption and service delay, MDs offload the resource-intensive tasks to nearby mobile edge server (MES) for execution . However, due to time varying network conditions and limited computing resources at MES also, the offloading decision taken by MDs may not achieve the lowest cost. In this paper, we propose an energy efficient and faster deep learning based offloading technique (EFDOT) to minimize the overall cost of MDs. We formulate a cost function which considers the energy consumption and service delay of MDs, radio resources, energy consumption and delay due to task partitioning, and computing resources of the MDs and MESs. Due to high computational overhead of this comprehensive cost function, we generate a training dataset to train a deep neural network (DNN) in order to make the decision making process faster. The proposed work finds the optimal number of components, task partitioning, and fine-grained offloading policy simultaneously. We formulate the fine-grained offloading decision problem in MEC as multi-label classification problem and propose EFDOT to minimize the computation and offloading overhead. The simulation results show high accuracy of the DNN and high performance of EFDOT in terms of energy consumption, service delay, and battery life.}

abstract = {The integration of 5G and Beyond 5G (B5G)/6G in Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications, is making Industry 4.0 smarter. However, the goal of having a sustainable self-monitored industry has not been reached yet. State-of-the-art deep learning-based Fault Detection algorithms cannot handle heterogeneous data, meaning that more than one fault detection computational device has to be used for each data format, in addition to the inability to take advantage of the combination of all the information available in different formats to derive more accurate conclusions. Moreover, these algorithms rely on inefficient hyper-parameters tuning strategies. In this paper, we propose an Advanced Deep Learning framework for Fault Diagnosis in Industry 4.0 (ADL-FDI4), which combines Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and graph CNN (GNN), to handle heterogeneous data. Furthermore, our novel framework uses a Branch-and-Bound procedure to guide the learning process. Our experimental results show that ADL-FDI4 outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions in terms of detection rate and running time, and for that, it consumes less energy. In addition to handling heterogeneous data, which implies that one computational device is sufficient to handle all data formats.}

ABSTRACT = {Automatic in-line process quality control plays a crucial role to enhance production efficiency in the injection molding industry. Industry 4.0 is leading the productivity and efficiency of companies to minimize scrap rates and strive for zero-defect production, especially in the injection molding industry. In this study, a fully automated closed-loop injection molding (IM) setup with a communication platform via OPC UA was built in compliance with Industry 4.0. The setup included fully automated inline measurements, in-line data analysis, and an AI control system to set the new machine parameters via the OPC UA communication protocol. The surface quality of the injection molded parts was rated using the ResNet-18 convolutional neural network, which was trained on data gathered by a heuristic approach. Further, eight different machine learning models for predicting the part quality (weight, surface quality, and dimensional properties) and for predicting sensor data were trained using data from a variety of production information sources, including in-mold sensors, injection molding machine (IMM) sensors, ambient sensors, and inline product quality measurements. These models are the backbone of the AI control system, which is a heuristic model predictive control (MPC) method. This method was applied to find new sets of machine parameters during production to control the specified part quality feature. The control system and predictive models were successfully tested for two groups of quality features: Geometry control and surface quality control. Control parameters were limited to injection speed and holding pressure. Moreover, the geometry control was repeated with mold temperature as an additional control parameter.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been an exploration of innovative electric grid concepts centered around power routers, devices capable of controlling power flows as desired. One of which is the Power Router Grid, a novel high-controllable network design fully based on power routers. Its ability to arbitrarily change power flows inside controllable lines raises the challenge of determining the optimal operation within such systems. This paper aims to push further the analysis of the operation and benefits of such networks by proposing a novel optimization model tailored for power router grids based on the most recent literature for the convexification of optimal power flows. Moreover, it demonstrated that radial-based models can be expanded for grids meshed through power routers. The model presented is also convex in the form of a second-order cone, ensuring a global optimum for diverse grid configurations. It has been implemented in Python using the PYOMO modeling language and applied to three case studies investigating the effects of power router operation modes on the grid’s optimal operation and associated costs. Results show that the definition of the power router grid design and the ports operation mode must be carefully decided when demand uncertainty of over 25% is taken into consideration. Moreover, controlling power flow near lines of higher impedance can lead up to a 21% increase in line losses.}

The framework and motivation for development of a multilayered protection and control scheme that starts with local measurement devices and integrated higher-level control schemes into an overall control strategy is presented.

It is an automated system of monitoring, control, and protection devices that improves the reliability of the transmission grid by preventing wide-spread break-ups.

ABSTRACT = {With the continuous development of renewable energy technologies, both domestically and internationally, the focus of energy research has gradually shifted towards renewable energy directions such as distributed photovoltaics and wind power. The penetration rate of renewable energy generation is constantly increasing, at the same time, the elements in the grid are becoming increasingly complex, and large-scale energy storage, as well as a variety of electricity loads such as electric vehicle charging piles and data centers are gradually appearing. Therefore, traditional distribution methods of the power grid are difficult to ensure the stable operation of the power system and cannot achieve efficient integration of renewable energy. Consequently, some scholars have proposed the concept of an energy internet. Compared to traditional power grids, the energy internet employs more comprehensive power electronics and communication technologies, enabling the interconnection of various new and traditional energy sources, and effectively integrating renewable energy. As the core device in the energy internet, the energy router plays a role in energy transformation and distribution, facilitating multi-information interconnection and multi-energy exchange within the energy internet. At the level of distribution network, the energy router can realize the efficient access of various forms of energy and the flexible control and management, which is of great significance for the optimal operation of distribution network. Against this backdrop, this paper reviews the development and current research status of energy routers, systematically analyzes the typical topologies and related control technologies of multi-port energy routers and summarizes and forecasts key issues and future development trends, aiming to provide thoughts and reference for subsequent related research.},

ABSTRACT = {At present, the development of the global energy internet is occurring in depth and the construction of a distributed power supply is rapid, and the energy router (ER), as a key device for integrating energy flow and information flow, has important application value in microgrids. In this paper, a multi-port energy router based on a 710 V DC bus is designed and developed with a modular structure design, including core components such as a total controller, a power converter, a hybrid energy storage system, and an auxiliary power supply. Flexible access and the management of multiple-voltage-level ports (690 V AC, 380 V AC, 220 V DC, and 24 V DC) are realized through rational topology design. The test results of the device show that the system performance indexes meet the design requirements. The operation is stable and reliable, displaying strong practical engineering value, and at the same time provides a technical solution that can be borrowed for other special scenarios such as the microgrid system.},

  abstract  = {The sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication networks are envisioned to revolutionize customer services and applications via the Internet of Things (IoT) toward a future of fully intelligent and autonomous systems. In this article, we explore the emerging opportunities brought by 6G technologies in IoT networks and applications, by conducting a holistic survey on the convergence of 6G and IoT. We first shed light on some of the most fundamental 6G technologies that are expected to empower future IoT networks, including edge intelligence, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, space-air-ground-underwater communications, Terahertz communications, massive ultrareliable and low-latency communications, and blockchain. Particularly, compared to the other related survey papers, we provide an in-depth discussion of the roles of 6G in a wide range of prospective IoT applications via five key domains, namely, healthcare IoTs, Vehicular IoTs and Autonomous Driving, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Satellite IoTs, and Industrial IoTs. Finally, we highlight interesting research challenges and point out potential directions to spur further research in this promising area.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things needs for computing power and storage are expected to remain on the rise in the next decade. Consequently, the amount of data generated by devices at the edge of the network will also grow. While cloud computing has been an established and effective way of acquiring computation and storage as a service to many applications, it may not be suitable to handle the myriad of data from IoT devices and fulfill largely heterogeneous application requirements. Fog computing has been developed to lie between IoT and the cloud, providing a hierarchy of computing power that can collect, aggregate, and process data from/to IoT devices. Combining fog and cloud may reduce data transfers and communication bottlenecks to the cloud and also contribute to reduced latencies, as fog computing resources exist closer to the edge. This paper examines this IoT-Fog-Cloud ecosystem and provides a literature review from different facets of it: how it can be organized, how management is being addressed, and how applications can benefit from it. Lastly, we present challenging issues yet to be addressed in IoT-Fog-Cloud infrastructures.}

abstract = {In recent years, especially during the outbreak of COVID-19, there have witnessed the emergence of online food delivery (OFD) services that allow customers to place orders via Internet-connected devices to obtain door-to-door delivered meals. In this service, on-time delivery to the right customer with high-quality fresh meals is deemed the primary factor. This paper investigates the reliability of OFD through its ability to meet customer needs in a specific context. During the delivery process, the courier receives the food at the store, packs it into a delivery box, and then delivers it to the customer. Note that, the delivery boxes are limited in space. Customers prefer having their orders delivered within a given time threshold. Thus, reliability is defined as the probability to complete non-integer and multiple orders under a limited time and space. Besides, the OFD system belongs to the gig economy, which allows couriers to select their shifts and working regions. Hence, the capacity of each region, which indicates the number of available couriers, is regarded as multistate. We, thus, construct the OFD system as a multistate online food delivery network (MOFN). Under the limitation of time and space, all feasible minimal capacity vectors are determined to compute the reliability. With the proposed investigation, managers can understand their MOFN’s ability to meet specific customer demands. Accordingly, they can make appropriate adjustments for better performance.}
