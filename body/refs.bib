One of the most widely accepted standards for power system communication is IEC 61850, which defines services and protocols with different requirements that need to be fulfilled with traffic engineering techniques. In this paper, we discuss the implementation of a novel management framework to meet these requirements through control and monitoring tools that provide a global view of the network. With this purpose, we provide an overview of relevant Software Defined Networking (SDN) related approaches, and we describe an architecture based on OpenFlow that establishes different types of flows according to their needs and the network status. We present the implementation of the architecture and evaluate its capabilities using the Mininet network emulator.}

However, embracing a new and futuristic paradigm as an alternative to well-established and mature legacy networking paradigm requires a lot of time along with considerable financial resources and technical expertise. Consequently, many enterprises cannot afford it. A compromise solution then is a hybrid networking environment (a.k.a. Hybrid SDN (hSDN)) in which SDN functionalities are leveraged while existing traditional network infrastructures are acknowledged. Recently, hSDN has been seen as a viable networking solution for a diverse range of businesses and organizations. Accordingly, the body of literature on hSDN research has improved remarkably. On this account, we present this paper as a comprehensive state-of-the-art survey which expands upon hSDN from many different perspectives.}

abstract="Software Defined Networking (SDN) enables flexible and dynamic control of packet forwarding and processing by decoupling the control plane and the data plane. However, to implement an efficient and reliable in-band SDN control channel to connect controller(s) and switch/router(s), conventional static schemes such as VLAN are insufficient especially in highly utilized and/or network-topology variable wireless networks. Therefore, a dynamic in-band control channel is considered which can piggyback (embed) control messages onto data packets flowing on the network. In this paper, we report a feasibility study on the dynamic in-band control channel implemented on the BMv2 router in Programming Protocol Independent Packet Processors (P4) framework. The adverse impact on the data plane performance is experimentally investigated. It is found that the TCP goodput and packet loss characteristics are degraded as the amount of embedded information increases but the significant impact comes from not embedding/extracting the control information on data packets but sending the extracted information to a controller; which give us hints to applicable conditions and possible improvements on the dynamic in-band control channel implementation.",

abstract = {A distinguishing characteristic of a software-defined network is separation of the network's control plane from its data plane. Especially when the granularity of control is an individual network flow, such separation entails frequent communications between these two planes. This communication pattern demands the same level of resilience from the control plane as that from the data plane, and thus calls into question the conventional out-of-band control network design as used in many existing SDN systems. Peregrine is an Ethernet-based software-defined network that was originally designed as the internal network of a container computer, and unifies storage access, inter-server communication, and network control into a single network comprising only commodity off-the-shelf Ethernet switches. To fully utilize all available physical network links, Peregrine treats the physical network as an explicitly routed mesh and equalizes the loads of its links using a global load-balancing routing algorithm running on a centralized controller. The in-band control architecture of Peregrine leads to two issues: (1) how to evolve a Peregrine network from its initial bootstrapping mode to the explicit routing mode at run time, and (2) how to support fast fail-over for physical failures that break both the control and data plane. This paper describes how Peregrine addresses these two issues, and shows its effectiveness with performance measurements collected from a fully operational test-bed.},

planes should be distributed. However, distributed control
planes are challenging to design and bootstrap, especially if
this is done in-band, without a dedicated control network,
and without relying on legacy protocols. We present Medieval,
a plug \& play, distributed control plane that supports
automatic topology discovery and management, as well as
flexible control plane membership: controllers can be added
and removed dynamically. Medieval comes with interesting
robustness guarantees and is provably self-stabilizing: from
any initial topology, the controllers quickly self-organize
and establish a communication channel among themselves.
Given the resulting managed control plane, arbitrary network
control services can be implemented on top. Interestingly,
Medieval is also self-reliant, in the sense that it is
based on OpenFlow only, and does not require any legacy
protocol to bootstrap.},

abstract = {By introducing programmability, automated verification, and innovative debugging tools, Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) are poised to meet the increasingly stringent dependability requirements of today's communication networks. However, the design of fault-tolerant SDNs remains an open challenge. This paper considers the design of dependable SDNs through the lenses of self-stabilization—a very strong notion of fault-tolerance. In particular, we develop algorithms for an in-band and distributed control plane for SDNs, called Renaissance, which tolerate a wide range of failures. Our self-stabilizing algorithms ensure that after the occurrence of arbitrary failures, (i) every non-faulty SDN controller can reach any switch (or another controller) within a bounded communication delay (in the presence of a bounded number of failures) and (ii) every switch is managed by a controller. We evaluate Renaissance through a rigorous worst-case analysis as well as a prototype implementation (based on OVS and Floodlight, and Mininet).}

abstract = {Fog computing is a paradigm that allows the provisioning of computational resources and services at the edge of the network, closer to the end devices and users, complementing cloud computing. The heterogeneity and large number of devices are challenges to obtaining optimized resource allocation in this environment. Over time, some surveys have been presented on resource management in fog computing. However, they now lack a broader and deeper view about this subject, considering the recent publications. This article presents a systematic literature review with a focus on resource allocation for fog computing, and in a more comprehensive way than the existing works. The survey is based on 108 selected publications from 2012 to 2022. The analysis have exposed their main techniques, metrics used, evaluation tools, virtualization methods, architecture, and domains where the proposed solutions were applied. The results show an updated and comprehensive view about resource allocation in fog computing. The main challenges and open research questions are discussed, and a new fog computing resource management cycle is proposed.},

abstract = {Limited battery and computing resources of mobile devices (MDs) induce performance limitations in mobile edge computing (MEC) networks. Computational offloading has the capability to provide computing and storage resources to MDs for resource-intensive tasks execution. Therefore, to minimize energy consumption and service delay, MDs offload the resource-intensive tasks to nearby mobile edge server (MES) for execution . However, due to time varying network conditions and limited computing resources at MES also, the offloading decision taken by MDs may not achieve the lowest cost. In this paper, we propose an energy efficient and faster deep learning based offloading technique (EFDOT) to minimize the overall cost of MDs. We formulate a cost function which considers the energy consumption and service delay of MDs, radio resources, energy consumption and delay due to task partitioning, and computing resources of the MDs and MESs. Due to high computational overhead of this comprehensive cost function, we generate a training dataset to train a deep neural network (DNN) in order to make the decision making process faster. The proposed work finds the optimal number of components, task partitioning, and fine-grained offloading policy simultaneously. We formulate the fine-grained offloading decision problem in MEC as multi-label classification problem and propose EFDOT to minimize the computation and offloading overhead. The simulation results show high accuracy of the DNN and high performance of EFDOT in terms of energy consumption, service delay, and battery life.}

abstract = {The integration of 5G and Beyond 5G (B5G)/6G in Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications, is making Industry 4.0 smarter. However, the goal of having a sustainable self-monitored industry has not been reached yet. State-of-the-art deep learning-based Fault Detection algorithms cannot handle heterogeneous data, meaning that more than one fault detection computational device has to be used for each data format, in addition to the inability to take advantage of the combination of all the information available in different formats to derive more accurate conclusions. Moreover, these algorithms rely on inefficient hyper-parameters tuning strategies. In this paper, we propose an Advanced Deep Learning framework for Fault Diagnosis in Industry 4.0 (ADL-FDI4), which combines Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and graph CNN (GNN), to handle heterogeneous data. Furthermore, our novel framework uses a Branch-and-Bound procedure to guide the learning process. Our experimental results show that ADL-FDI4 outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions in terms of detection rate and running time, and for that, it consumes less energy. In addition to handling heterogeneous data, which implies that one computational device is sufficient to handle all data formats.}

ABSTRACT = {Automatic in-line process quality control plays a crucial role to enhance production efficiency in the injection molding industry. Industry 4.0 is leading the productivity and efficiency of companies to minimize scrap rates and strive for zero-defect production, especially in the injection molding industry. In this study, a fully automated closed-loop injection molding (IM) setup with a communication platform via OPC UA was built in compliance with Industry 4.0. The setup included fully automated inline measurements, in-line data analysis, and an AI control system to set the new machine parameters via the OPC UA communication protocol. The surface quality of the injection molded parts was rated using the ResNet-18 convolutional neural network, which was trained on data gathered by a heuristic approach. Further, eight different machine learning models for predicting the part quality (weight, surface quality, and dimensional properties) and for predicting sensor data were trained using data from a variety of production information sources, including in-mold sensors, injection molding machine (IMM) sensors, ambient sensors, and inline product quality measurements. These models are the backbone of the AI control system, which is a heuristic model predictive control (MPC) method. This method was applied to find new sets of machine parameters during production to control the specified part quality feature. The control system and predictive models were successfully tested for two groups of quality features: Geometry control and surface quality control. Control parameters were limited to injection speed and holding pressure. Moreover, the geometry control was repeated with mold temperature as an additional control parameter.},
